—</p>

<p>In 2025, the cyber threat landscape is being redrawn by a new generation of attackers — and they’re not just script kiddies in their mom’s basement. Nation-states, in today’s post: <strong>North Korea</strong>, are at the forefront, blending traditional espionage with bleeding-edge AI tactics to fund regimes, bypass defenses, and infiltrate critical industries. Something many believe they couldn’t do.</p>

<h2 id="-north-koreas-playbook-ai-fake-jobs-real-damage">🎯 North Korea’s Playbook: AI, Fake Jobs, Real Damage</h2>

<p>North Korea’s Lazarus Group — one of the world’s most active and financially motivated threat actors — is no longer just stealing crypto wallets. They’ve moved into <strong>large-scale IT fraud campaigns</strong>, <strong>AI-generated fake profiles</strong>, and even <strong>infiltration of tech firms via remote work scams</strong> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s chilling:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI-generated personas</strong> were used to apply for software engineering roles at U.S. crypto and tech companies <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Once inside, operatives deployed malware and established persistent backdoors.</li>
  <li>This operation alone is believed to have netted <strong>tens of millions of dollars</strong>, funneling revenue back to the regime while evading sanctions <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These weren’t isolated scams. Fake U.S. firms like <em>Blocknovas LLC</em> and <em>Softglide LLC</em> were set up to launch job offers and lure developers <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Victims weren’t just tricked — they were recruited into what seemed like legitimate blockchain teams, only to have their systems compromised from within.</p>

<h2 id="-ai-the-double-edged-sword">🤖 AI: The Double-Edged Sword</h2>

<p>At the same time, <strong>AI is making cybercrime cheaper, faster, and more convincing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attackers can now create AI models capable of <strong>bypassing major antivirus services</strong> almost 10% of the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> are being abused to write phishing emails, generate fake websites, and automate impersonation <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Even high-profile tools like <strong>AI hiring platforms</strong> have been compromised due to simple missteps like weak admin passwords from careless Devs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-industry-complacency-around-ai-threats">🧠 Industry Complacency Around AI Threats</h2>

<p>One of the most dangerous trends right now is the <strong>underestimation of AI threats</strong> — not just in terms of capability, but in terms of <strong>who</strong> has access. Many companies falsely assume that nations labeled as “less developed” or politically isolated lack the resources to harness powerful AI tools.</p>

<p>That assumption is proving disastrous.</p>

<p><strong>North Korean actors are actively using AI-powered face-swapping and profile generation</strong> to trick hiring teams and compromise internal systems <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. These aren’t hypothetical scenarios — they’ve already happened, and they’ve already worked. The idea that AI is only a concern for the most advanced economies is not only outdated — it’s reckless.</p>

<p>AI is not a luxury anymore. It’s a commodity — and <strong>it’s in the hands of adversaries who have every incentive to use it aggressively</strong>.</p>

<p>Companies that delay improving hiring vetting, MFA enforcement, and phishing-resistant identity controls because they “don’t think North Korea has ChatGPT” are sleepwalking into serious compromise.</p>

<h2 id="️-why-it-matters">⚠️ Why It Matters</h2>

<p>North Korea’s focus isn’t just about disruption — it’s economic survival. Cybercrime is their business model. And with AI lowering the barrier to entry, expect these operations to scale further.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, defenders are playing catch-up. Many still rely on outdated credential policies, lack phishing-resistant MFA, or fail to screen remote applicants thoroughly — cracks that state-backed actors are more than happy to exploit.</p>

<h2 id="-final-thoughts">💡 Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The 2025 threat landscape isn’t just shaped by technology — it’s defined by <strong>how that technology is used</strong>, and by <strong>whom</strong>. Whether you’re a cybersecurity pro, a hiring manager, or just someone logging into a crypto app, vigilance now means understanding that the person on the other end of the screen might not be a person at all.</p>

<p>AI is changing the game — and <strong>North Korea is already winning the first round</strong>.</p>

<p>Costello: Funny names?</p>

<p>Abbott: Nicknames, nicknames. Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third–</p>

<p>Costello: That’s what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.</p>

<p>Abbott: I’m telling you. Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third–</p>

<p>Costello: You know the fellows’ names?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, then who’s playing first?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: I mean the fellow’s name on first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who.</p>

<p>Costello: The fellow playin’ first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who.</p>

<p>Costello: The guy on first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who is on first.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, what are you askin’ me for?</p>

<p>Abbott: I’m not asking you–I’m telling you. Who is on first.</p>

<p>Costello: I’m asking you–who’s on first?</p>

<p>Abbott: That’s the man’s name.</p>

<p>Costello: That’s who’s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?</p>

<p>Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man’s entitled to it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who is?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: So who gets it?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why shouldn’t he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who’s wife?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who does?</p>

<p>Abbott: Absolutely.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, all I’m trying to find out is what’s the guy’s name on first base?</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.</p>

<p>Costello: I’m not asking you who’s on second.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who’s on first!</p>

<p>Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>Costello: The left fielder’s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why.</p>

<p>Costello: I don’t know, I just thought I’d ask.</p>

<p>Abbott: Well, I just thought I’d tell you.</p>

<p>Costello: Then tell me who’s playing left field?</p>

<p>Abbott: Who’s playing first.</p>

<p>Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder’s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why.</p>

<p>Costello: Because.</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, he’s center field.</p>

<p>Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?</p>

<p>Abbott: Wouldn’t this be a fine team without a pitcher?</p>

<p>Costello: Tell me the pitcher’s name.</p>

<p>Abbott: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball–me being a good catcher–I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?</p>

<p>Abbott: Now, that’s he first thing you’ve said right.</p>

<p>Costello: I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!</p>

<p>Abbott: Don’t get excited. Take it easy.</p>

<p>Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don’t know. I don’t know throws it back to tomorrow–a triple play.</p>

<p>Abbott: Yeah, it could be.</p>

<p>Costello: Another guy gets up and it’s a long ball to center.</p>

<p>Abbott: Because.</p>

<p>Costello: Why? I don’t know. And I don’t care.</p>

<p>Abbott: What was that?</p>

<p>Costello: I said, I DON’T CARE!</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.</p>

<p>This post has a manual excerpt <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">excerpt_separator</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">&lt;!--more--&gt;"</span>

<p>If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.</p>

<p>Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.</p>

They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.]]></summary></entry></feed>
