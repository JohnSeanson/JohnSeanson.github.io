> **“Cybersecurity must be treated like compliance.”**

As a former financial advisor turned to cybersecurity, I’ve seen firsthand how easily sensitive client data can be put at risk—not through sophisticated hacking, but through simple, everyday decisions. In the financial world, trust is currency. If a client’s personal information is exposed—even accidentally—that trust can evaporate in an instant. Worse, it can invite regulatory scrutiny, lawsuits, or even the end of your practice.

This post breaks down the real-world mistakes I witnessed and the practical ways advisors can avoid becoming the next cautionary tale.

## Financial Advisors Face Unique Risk

Financial advisors are prime targets for cyber threats because they work with highly sensitive data every day: Social Security numbers, account balances, tax documents, investment strategies, and more. This isn’t just about protecting information—it’s about complying with FINRA, SEC, and state-level regulations that mandate the safeguarding of client data.

Unlike large financial firms with dedicated IT teams, many solo advisors and small firms don’t have robust cybersecurity support. That means it’s up to the advisor to make the right decisions—often in high-pressure, client-facing situations.

Even today many advisors are not aware of the cybersecurity risks they face. Or perhaps, they feel an incident will never happen to them. Unfortunately, this mindset isn’t just risky—it’s been costly. In recent years, the SEC has fined even small firms and solo RIAs for failing to adopt basic cybersecurity controls, with penalties ranging from \$75,000 to \$300,000.

## Real-World Mistakes That Create Cyber Risk

Here are scenarios I witnessed first hand in the industry.

### Meeting Clients in Public Places and Using Public WiFi

Coffee shops and casual settings can feel like good places to meet clients, especially during the discovery phase. It’s low pressure and a great way to build rapport. But connecting to open Wi-Fi networks while reviewing or collecting client data is a serious risk.

These networks can be exploited by hackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where all transmitted data can be intercepted. It is easy to peg a Financial Advisor at work, many of us would frequent the same popular locations for our client meetings. A threat actor just has to be patient.

> *“A threat actor doesn’t need to hack anything. They can sit nearby, create a fake 'Starbucks Guest Wi-Fi' network, and watch as advisors unknowingly connect—handing over sensitive traffic without realizing it.”*

**Better practice**: Use a personal mobile hotspot or a VPN to encrypt traffic. Ideally, avoid accessing sensitive data altogether in public places. It is better to meet in a secure office setting and many office sharing facilities are available to offer a great feeling of professionalism and security to boot.

### Accepting Client Thumb Drives

It's tempting to plug in a USB drive when a client hands it to you and says, “Here’s everything you need.” But you have no idea what’s on that drive—or what malware might be lurking. Can you truly trust this individual?

Attackers have even been known to drop infected USB sticks in parking lots, hoping someone picks one up and plugs it in—a tactic called a 'USB drop attack.' If malware can spread this easily among strangers, imagine how vulnerable your system is when you're accepting drives from clients who might have infected home devices.

Even well-meaning clients can accidentally spread malware picked up from another device. They may practice sloppy digital hygiene at home or have out-of-date antivirus software. A single infected USB stick can compromise your entire system - like a ticking bomb. A USB drive may be easier for your client, but inconvenience for the sake of security can protect you and your other clients. Advisors must accept the fact that at times you will have to walk clients through technological barriers.

**Better practice**: Ask clients to upload files via encrypted cloud storage (e.g., ShareFile, OneDrive with MFA, Dropbox with password protection). Never plug unknown devices into your computer.

### Using Laptops Without Privacy Screens in Public

If you're working from an airport, coffee shop, or even a conference, and reviewing sensitive client info without a privacy screen, you’re broadcasting that data to anyone sitting nearby. And it is something many Advisors don’t give a second thought to. I quickly learned this the hard way while reviewing a client’s plan in a coffee shop and someone walking by asked, “Oh do you trade stocks?” and stared at my screen which could have easily been displaying PPI.

> *“Visual hacking is surprisingly common—and easy to execute.”*

**Better practice**: Install a privacy filter on your laptop. It’s cheap, it’s simple, and it makes a huge difference. Also, position yourself away from public view when handling sensitive information. Just don’t access PPI in public places.

### Leaving Devices with Clients

Some advisors leave their laptop or tablet unattended with a client while stepping away to grab documents or take a call. This might seem harmless, but it opens the door to unauthorized access, accidental data exposure, or even deliberate data theft.

I have seen this far too many times.

**Better practice**: Lock your screen anytime you step away, even for a minute. Treat all devices like they contain cash—because to a hacker or criminal, they do.

## The Fallout from Cybersecurity Failures

The cost of these mistakes can be devastating:

* Regulatory penalties: FINRA can fine advisors or firms for inadequate data security practices.
* Client loss: One breach is enough for a client to walk away—and take others with them.
* Legal exposure: Breaches can lead to lawsuits for negligence or failure to safeguard information.
* Reputational damage: Your name is your brand. Once tarnished, it’s hard to rebuild.

> **“Cybersecurity isn’t just a technical issue—it’s a business survival issue.”**

These aren’t hypotheticals. R.T. Jones, a small advisory firm, was fined \$75,000 by the SEC after a data breach exposed over 100,000 records—and they didn’t even have written cybersecurity policies. In 2021, three mid-sized RIAs were hit with fines up to \$300,000 for failing to prevent email compromises.

## Simple, Powerful Practices Every Advisor Should Follow

* Encrypt all devices (laptops, phones, tablets).
* Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts.
* Send and receive documents through secure portals—not email attachments.
* Have a basic cybersecurity policy in place, even if you’re a solo advisor.
* Stay informed: Follow security news relevant to the financial industry.

## Conclusion: Be the Advisor Clients Can Trust

Cybersecurity doesn’t have to be overwhelming, but it does have to be taken seriously. Your clients trust you with their life savings, retirement dreams, and financial legacy. The least you can do is make sure their data is treated with the same care.

> *“We build rapport with our clients, we trust them, we begin to see some of them as family. But in cybersecurity we practice such concepts as 'Zero Trust.'”*

Zero Trust is a cybersecurity principle that assumes no person or device should be trusted by default—even those inside your network. While this may feel counterintuitive in a relationship-driven profession, it’s essential for ensuring only authorized users access client data.

Such concepts need to be adopted in your practice to ensure no one has access to information that they shouldn't.

In a highly regulated, high-trust industry, being known as the advisor who prioritizes security is more than just smart—it’s essential.

## 🚨 Call to Action

If you’re a solo advisor or small firm unsure where to start:

🔐 Start with MFA.
🛡️ Encrypt your devices.
📶 Stop trusting public Wi-Fi.

If you're unsure about your exposure, consult a cybersecurity professional—or schedule a risk assessment today.
