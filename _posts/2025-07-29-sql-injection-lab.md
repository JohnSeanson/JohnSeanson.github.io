🔍 **Introduction**

I’ve been digging into real-world threats that undermine trust in digital systems. SQL injection (SQLi) is one of the most widely exploited vulnerabilities—still sitting near the top of OWASP’s threat list. To sharpen my incident detection skills and understand attacker methodology, I launched a hands-on lab exploring how malicious actors weaponize SQLi and how defenders can build resilience into their applications and infrastructure.

🧪 **Lab Setup**

My lab environment mirrored what a typical attacker might encounter when probing public-facing web portals. Here's the stack I used:

**Test Platforms:** bWAPP and DVWA running on Ubuntu and Kali Linux virtual machines.

**Tools:**
- Burp Suite for HTTP intercept and payload injection
- Firefox dev tools and curl for lightweight testing
- Manual log inspection and Zeek (for future log parsing integration)

**Targeted Features:** login fields, search bars, and feedback forms—anywhere user input meets backend queries

I kept detailed logs and screenshots of payload attempts, tracking both successful exploitation and failed attempts to identify mitigation behaviors.

🧵 **Payload Walkthrough**

This section demonstrates the progression from basic tampering to deeper schema access:

✅ **Authentication Bypass**

- **Payload:** `' OR '1'='1`
- **Outcome:** Unlocked basic login functionality
- Various usernames and passwords revealed

Each payload was documented with:
- Full query syntax
- Application response
- Notes on why it succeeded (or failed)
- Mitigation hints, such as evidence of input sanitization or WAF activity

🛡️ **Defender’s Lens & Key Takeaways**

This exercise wasn’t just about exploitation—it was about defense.

**The Attacker’s Mindset:** Groups like Chaos thrive on automation and speed. SQLi helps them probe thousands of endpoints rapidly. Understanding their toolkit helps defenders set better traps.

**Why Input Validation Isn’t Enough:** Many apps still trust user input. Without prepared statements or parameterized queries, injection remains viable—even for legacy financial systems.

**Countermeasures Tested:**
- WAF blocking of UNION queries
- Error suppression settings
- Implementation of PDOs in app rebuilds

This tied directly into my financial background: if client portals or budgeting tools are vulnerable, the entire trust ecosystem erodes.

🎯 **Conclusion**

This lab reaffirmed my belief that defenders must think like adversaries. SQL injection isn’t just a theoretical concept—it’s alive, adaptable, and relevant. By stepping into the attacker’s shoes, I learned how fragile unprotected apps can be—and how strategic countermeasures can harden them fast.

**Next up:** I’ll be integrating log analysis and SIEM concepts using Zeek and Splunk to detect signs of injection in real time. Every system leaves traces, and learning how to spot them could make all the difference.
